When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	sometimes, i may think to use the github account to make changes. In that situation, I can do it manually using my github account and pull the changes into my local machine

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I usually work on my local machine to upgrade the project I currently working on. so, I always want to pull whatever the changes happened in my repo.
